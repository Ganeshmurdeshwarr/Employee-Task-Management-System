Employee Task Management System (React.js)
Overview

This is a React.js web application for managing tasks in an organization. It provides separate dashboards for Admin and Employees:

Admin Dashboard: Create tasks, assign tasks to employees, and track task counts.

Employee Dashboard: View tasks, track progress, and update task status (New, Active, Completed, Failed).

The app uses React Context for state management and localStorage to persist data.
